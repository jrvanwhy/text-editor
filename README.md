# My text editor

I used vim for over a decade, but have had two major annoyances with it:

1. I developed my muscle memory while editing tab-indented codebases, but now
   work primarily on space-indented codebases. I was never able to adjust my
   muscle memory, and I want my text editor to make the editing experience for
   space-indented code to feel like tab-indented code (and in particular,
   backspace needs to delete the corresponding number of characters -- I have
   never found an editor that can be configured to get that correct!).
2. Sometimes its behavior on certain filetypes changes (I assume due to filetype
   plugin updates), again breaking muscle memory.

Since I don't actually use many features, I'm hoping it is feasible for me to
write my own editor and use it.
